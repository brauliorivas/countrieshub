# countrieshub

Hi, this is the link https://countrieshub.vercel.app/

I made this countries hub, where you can find a lot of information from each country. 
The app fetches the restcountries.com api, and the brings all the info. You can search by name 
and filter. Also, on click you get more info about the selected country

This app is made with React, uses Sass por style and I have swc compiler, with webpack bundler.
