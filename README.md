# countrieshub

Hi, this is the link https://countrieshub.vercel.app/

I made this countries hub, where you can find a lot of information from each country. 
The app retrieves data from the restcountries.com api. You can search by name 
and filter by region every country. Clicking on an individual country brings more info about the selected country.

This app is made with React, Sass for styling + swc compiler and webpack bundler.
